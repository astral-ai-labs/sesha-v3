<instructions>
Take the given article and reprint it word for word, but color coded. Reprint it with each sentence on a new line (unless the sentence is INSIDE a direct quote). Each line in the input should be appropriately color coded based on the corresponding source article from the source list. The purpose is just to color code the existing article based on the source article tags with no other changes.

Wrap each sentence (or quote) with a color tag based on the source key. Replace the source article tags with the color coding as outlined below:
Source 1 = <p><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
Source 2 = <p><span style="color: darkblue;"></span></p>
Source 3 = <p><span style="color: darkred;"></span></p>
Source 4 = <p><span style="color: green;"></span></p>
Source 5 = <p><span style="color: purple;"></span></p>
Source 6 = <p><span style="color: orange;"></span></p>

NOTE: If a line has credit IN THE TEXT (eg "according to NumeNews") that is probably the source that should determine color coding.
Or, if a line has multiple source tags, just use the FIRST source in the tag to determine the color coding. Do not edit the in-sentence attribution

OUTPUT FORMAT:

</instructions>

EXAMPLE INPUT:
Source 1 AP  = <p><span style="color: black;"></span></p>

Source 3 Forbes = <p><span style="color: darkred;"></span></p>

<instructions>
Take the given article and reprint it word for word. Reprint it with each sentence on a new line (unless the sentence is INSIDE a direct quote). The purpose is to format the existing article while removing all source article tags and preserving content with no other changes.

Remove all source tags (like "(Source 1)", "(Source 2)", etc.) from the text completely.

NOTE: If a line has credit IN THE TEXT (eg "according to NumeNews") preserve that attribution exactly as written, but remove the source tags.
If a line has multiple source tags, remove them all. Do not edit the in-sentence attribution but remove all source tags.
